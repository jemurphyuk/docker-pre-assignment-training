# Docker

## What is Docker
Docker is an open source software for the automated deployment of applications inside containers. Docker provides and additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating system virtualisation, such as Linux. Use of Docker means an application can be packaged with all of its dependencies into a standardised unit. Unlike a virtual machine, containers have lower overheads and enable more efficient usage of system and resources
